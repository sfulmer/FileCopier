# FileCopier

I'm having a problem where an external drive is failing and I need to get the data off - I can't seem to get Linux to install to an older laptop so I'm trying here a method writing a program that will recursively copy the files to another location and if it stalls/fails at any point, saves the last position in the file and starts fresh from that location next time it resumes - as I wish Windows 10 did.  

That's what this program does.
